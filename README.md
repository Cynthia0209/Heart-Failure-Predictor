# Heart-Failure-Predictor

Here is a model using "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records " to predict if a person we describe will survive a heart attack. Building this model would be important in many situations, like helping doctors make decisions (like when deciding who to save if there is a shortage of equipment available). 
Through **KNN classification**, we will answer:

**Will a 60 year old person with an ejection fraction of 40% survive heart failure?**
